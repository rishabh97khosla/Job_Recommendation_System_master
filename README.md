# Job-recommendation-system
The dataset is available on kaggle. I could not upload it because of large size of the data.
I have builded a Job reommendation system which is content based filtering will show us how we can recommend items to people just based on the attributes of the items themselves. It gives top N jobs recommendation using TF-IDF and Nearest Neighbor.
Also using COSIN similarity measure to check how many in common have them.
